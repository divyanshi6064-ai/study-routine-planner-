Project Title:

                       Smart Daily Routine Optimizer


Motivation:


This project was developed as part of the “Introduction to Problem Solving & Programming (Flipped Course)” to help students manage their daily routine in an organized and efficient way. Many students struggle with balancing study hours, class timings, sleep, refresh time, hobby time, and eating schedules. This Smart Daily Routine Optimizer simplifies time management by generating a personalized routine based on user inputs. The project applies fundamental programming concepts and GUI development skills using Python.

Data Description:

This project does not use any external datasets. All data is collected directly from user inputs entered into the application.

User Inputs Include:

• Wake-up time  
• Study hours  
• Class hours  
• Sleep hours  
• Eating hours  
• Refresh hours  
• Hobby/Passion hours  
• Break duration (in minutes)

Generated Outputs:


• Morning study session  
• Break time  
• Evening study session  
• Class hours  
• Sleep schedule  
• Eating time distribution (breakfast, lunch, dinner)  
• Refresh time  
• Hobby/Passion time  
• Free time calculation  
• Productivity score  
• Personalized suggestion  


All calculations and outputs are generated internally using Python functions and displayed through the Tkinter GUI.

How to Use:


1. Install Python 3.x on your system.  
2. Run the file “source_code.py” using Python.  
3. A splash screen will appear, followed by the main application interface.  
4. Enter your daily routine details in the right-side panel.  
5. Click “Generate Routine” to view your optimized schedule.  
6. The routine table and suggestion will appear in the center panel.  
7. Use “Clear Table” to reset the routine.  
8. The left panel includes:  
   • Digital clock  
   • Analog clock  
   • Pomodoro-style Focus Timer  
9. A monthly calendar is displayed below the routine table.  
10. Close the window to exit the application.
